### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had to take a longer time working with the movie poster because I downloaded the latest version of AlamofireImage. Xcode didn't give a shortcut to writing cell.posterView.af_selfImage(...), but I wrote it manually and xcode was able to understand it. 

Auto layout was also a bit challenging because I had to add constraints for two labels. It would sometimes overlap with each other and that produced an error. After playing around with it, I was able to understand how to give proper constraints for each label.
